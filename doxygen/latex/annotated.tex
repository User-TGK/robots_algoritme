\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classApplication}{Application} \\*Super class for an application instance. The application can be either the interactive mode, the batchmode and the calibration mode. For each deriving class the pure virtual \hyperlink{classApplication_a7dd8e91a715194dd391be7ae3ecdd985}{run()} function will be implemented and run in the main }{\pageref{classApplication}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classBatchApplication}{Batch\+Application} \\*Instance of an application. The batch application starts the batch mode in the \hyperlink{classBatchApplication_a5338e7513a806b5e751f92d0704d0f8b}{run()} function that stays active until all specifications are handled. The application will display the result for a specification a couple of times (itering as much as specified in frames\+Per\+Spec) before moving to the next specification }{\pageref{classBatchApplication}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classCalibrationMode}{Calibration\+Mode} \\*Calibrationmode is used to calibrate the color ranges. The mode will open up a window with sliders to adjust the color ranges for each color, a window with live frames from the camera and a window that shows the last frame after feature-\/extraction }{\pageref{classCalibrationMode}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structcolorRange}{color\+Range} \\*Struct that contains mapped values for a supported color }{\pageref{structcolorRange}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classDetector}{Detector} \\*The detector class handles all functionality concerning the feature-\/detecting process It will to to recognize pre-\/defined shapes on a binary image (a captured image after feature-\/extracting) }{\pageref{classDetector}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classExtractor}{Extractor} \\*The extractor class filters a raw image untill a simple binary image is left with only the pixels remaining that were in range of the configured color range (minus noise). The feature-\/extraction must always happen before feature-\/detection (read \hyperlink{Detection_8hpp_source}{Detection.\+hpp}) }{\pageref{classExtractor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structFilterDetails}{Filter\+Details} \\*Struct that contains the details of the filter result for a specific specification }{\pageref{structFilterDetails}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classFilterExecutor}{Filter\+Executor} \\*Filter executor combines the provided functionality by the detection and extraction classes. It will make sure every image is filtered properly and only the shape requested in a specification is marked. When finished it will make sure the result of a specification is showed to the user }{\pageref{classFilterExecutor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classInteractiveApplication}{Interactive\+Application} \\*Instance of an application. The interactive application starts the interactive mode in the \hyperlink{classInteractiveApplication_ae77593fe90fa4fae53dc8ca84ba1a239}{run()} function that stays active until the user specifies the \textquotesingle{}exit\textquotesingle{} command on the console. The application will display the result for a specification until a new specification is given }{\pageref{classInteractiveApplication}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classParser}{Parser} \\*\hyperlink{classParser}{Parser} contains all functionality to parse batch files and specifications }{\pageref{classParser}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structSpecification}{Specification} \\*Filtering process is based on a specification. This struct describes the attributes a specification has }{\pageref{structSpecification}}{}
